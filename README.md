This repository provides the code for the manuscript submitted to TKDE, which is "***Exploring Cost-Effective and Explainable Job
Skill Recommendation: A Prototype-enhanced
Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach***". 

This work is a substantially extended and revised version of our previous paper [Cost-Effective and Interpretable Job Skill Recommendation with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3449985), which appears in the Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021 (WWWâ€™ 2021). The code is based on [SkillRec](https://github.com/sunyinggilly/SkillRec) and [TensorFlow 1.15](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorflow).
